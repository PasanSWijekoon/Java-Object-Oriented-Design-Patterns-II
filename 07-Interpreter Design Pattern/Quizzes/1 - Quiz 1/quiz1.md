### Smart Home Command Interpreter

**Background:**

You are part of a software team developing an intelligent voice assistant for a smart home automation system. Users can give voice commands in natural language, such as:

* "turn on kitchen light"
* "turn off bedroom fan"
* "increase temperature by 5"
* "decrease temperature by 3"

To process these commands, your system first converts the voice into text. However, now you need to **parse and interpret these textual commands** into actions that the system can execute.

Rather than hardcoding each command with if-else statements, your architect suggests using the Interpreter Design Pattern to improve maintainability and extensibility.

**Task:**

Design a command interpreter system using the Interpreter Design Pattern to handle user commands for the smart home.
