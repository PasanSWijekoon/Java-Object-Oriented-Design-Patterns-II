### How Others Do It (Without Interpreter Pattern)

**Code Breakdown:**

```java
class Calculator {
    public int calculate(String expression) {
        String[] tokens = expression.split(" ");
        int result = Integer.parseInt(tokens[0]);

        for (int i = 1; i < tokens.length; i = i + 2) {
            String operator = tokens[i];
            int number = Integer.parseInt(tokens[i + 1]);

            switch (operator) {
                case "+":
                    result += number;
                    break;
                case "-":
                    result -= number;
                    break;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

public class Interpreter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator cal = new Calculator();
        System.out.println("Result: " + cal.calculate("10 - 2 + 4"));
    }
}
```

**Problems:**

  * **Hardcoded logic:** The code directly parses the input string based on a fixed pattern (number, operator, number, operator, ...). This approach is rigid and can only handle simple, linear expressions with a single level of precedence (left-to-right evaluation).
  * **Difficult to extend:** Adding new operations like multiplication (`*`) or division (`/`) would require modifying the `switch` statement. Supporting parentheses or more complex expressions would be nearly impossible without a complete rewrite of the parsing and evaluation logic. The code doesn't have a clear structure to accommodate these changes.
  * **No clear structure for grammar:** The code lacks a formal representation of the language's grammar. It relies on a simple `split(" ")` operation, which assumes a very specific input format. This makes the code fragile and difficult to understand or maintain. It doesn't model the problem in terms of "expressions," "terms," or "factors."
