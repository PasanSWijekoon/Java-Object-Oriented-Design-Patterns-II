### Introduction

- **Definition:** A Compound Pattern is a design solution that combines two or more patterns to address complex design issues.
- They often appear in real-world systems where a single pattern alone is not enough.
- **Example:** MVC (Model-View-Controller) combines Observer, Strategy, and Composite.

### Why Use Compound Patterns?

- Complex problems require multiple solutions.
- Increases flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.
- Avoids reinventing the wheel by reusing proven solutions.
- Patterns complement each other's strengths.
