### Scenario 1:

You are developing a role-playing game where players select one of three base character types: Warrior (power 100), Archer (power 80), or Mage (power 70). Players want to enhance their characters by applying any combination of upgrades such as Fire Enchantment (+30 power), Armor Upgrade (+40 power), Speed Boost (+20 power), and Magic Shield (+50 power). The system must allow players to pick a character and add multiple upgrades in any order at runtime. Also, it should be easy to add new character types or upgrades later without modifying existing code. When displaying the character, the full description should include all applied upgrades (e.g., “Warrior with Fire Enchantment with Armor Upgrade”), and the total power should reflect the base power plus all upgrades.
